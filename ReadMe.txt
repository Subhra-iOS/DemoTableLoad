I am able to download facts.json but while try to parse data from that file get error. Apart from that all functionalities are done. I am not able check the image download functionality, as JSON parsing getting error.

Other than I have done all required coding for this POC.

Functionalities:

1. UI design without XIB or storyboard.
2. Fetch Data (But data comes get nil value while convert to String with .utf8)
3. Pull to refresh.
